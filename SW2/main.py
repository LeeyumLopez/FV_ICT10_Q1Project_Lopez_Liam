# SW2/main.py
# This file contains simple restaurant metadata and a menu list used by the
# `SW2/index.html` page. The values here are read by the page's PyScript code
# to populate the UI (restaurant name, owner, year established, and menu items).
#
# Notes:
# - Prices are represented as numbers (treated as PHP currency in the UI).
# - This module currently only holds data; presentation and DOM updates are
#   handled in the HTML page's PyScript blocks which import or reference this file.

# Menu: list of dicts with `name` and `price` keys. Prices are integers (â‚±).
